# 🧠 Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging using spaCy and Hidden Markov Models

This project explores **Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** — the process of labeling words in a sentence with their grammatical roles — using both rule-based and statistical approaches. It uses **spaCy** for modern NLP pipelines and implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** for understanding the probabilistic side of POS tagging.

## 📚 What is POS Tagging?

**Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** is the process of assigning a part of speech (like noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence, based on both its definition and context.

## 📘 Definition of Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model that represents systems where the states are hidden (not directly observable), but produce observable outputs. It assumes the system follows a Markov process with hidden states, where:

- The current state depends only on the previous state (Markov assumption).
- Each hidden state emits an observable output according to some probability distribution.
  
In simpler terms:
An HMM is a probabilistic model that tells us how a sequence of visible events (like words) is generated by a sequence of invisible causes (like POS tags).

## 🧩 HMM Components (in context of POS tagging)
- States: The possible POS tags (e.g., Noun, Verb, Adjective)
- Observations: The actual words in the sentence.
- Transition Probabilities: Likelihood of moving from one POS tag to another.
- Emission Probabilities: Likelihood of a word being generated from a given tag.
- Initial Probabilities: Probability of starting with a particular POS tag.

## 🔄 Key Property
The model uses the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently find the most likely sequence of hidden states (POS tags) for a given sequence of observations (words).
For example, in the sentence:

We might tag the words as:

- The → Determiner (DET)  
- dog → Noun (NOUN)  
- barked → Verb (VERB)  
- at → Preposition (ADP)  
- the → Determiner (DET)  
- cat → Noun (NOUN)

## 🛠️ Approaches Used

### 🔹 1. **Rule-Based Tagging with spaCy**
- Uses the `en_core_web_sm` model for linguistic analysis.
- Handles tokenization, tagging, parsing, and more.
- Visualizes sentence structure using `displaCy`.

### 🔹 2. **Statistical Tagging with Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**
- A probabilistic model that calculates the most likely tag sequence for a given sentence.
- Considers transition probabilities (POS-to-POS) and emission probabilities (POS-to-word).
- Implemented from scratch for educational purposes.
